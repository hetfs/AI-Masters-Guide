## 🧠 Contribution Guidelines

To keep the project clean and consistent:

- Use **Markdown** (`.md`) for all documentation.

- Follow the existing **folder and file naming conventions** (e.g., kebab-case).

- Use **relative links** for internal Docusaurus navigation:  
  Example: `[Contributing](../contributing.md)`

- Keep content **clear, concise, and educational**. Emojis for clarity are welcome! 😊

- Run a **link check** if you've added or modified external URLs.

- Preview documentation changes locally with Docusaurus before submitting, if possible.
