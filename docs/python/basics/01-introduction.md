# 🚀 Introduction

*Setup your environment, write your first Python program, and understand how this roadmap works.*

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
* How to set up Python on your computer
* Choosing and configuring your code editor
* Writing and running your very first Python program
* Understanding how this roadmap is structured

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install Python**
   * Download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   * During installation, check the box **“Add Python to PATH”**.

2. **Install a Code Editor**
   * Recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * Alternative: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
   * Advance user: [Nveovim](https://neovim.io/)

3. **Verify Installation**
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```text
   Python 3.x.x
   ```

---

## 👩‍💻 Step 2: Write Your First Python Program

Create a new file called `hello.py` and type:

```python
print("Hello, Python World!")
```

Run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```

✅ Output:
```text
Hello, Python World!
```

🎉 Congratulations! You just ran your first Python program.

## 📘 Step 3: How This Roadmap Works

This roadmap is divided into **24 chapters + appendices**.
Each chapter contains:

* 📖 **Concept explanation** (what you’re learning)
* 🧩 **Examples** (how it works in practice)
* 💻 **Starter code** (`starter.py`) so you can code right away

By the end, you’ll be able to automate tasks, work with data, and even build real-world applications.

---

## 🚀 Starter Code

Here’s your **Introduction starter template**:

```python
# Introduction Starter Template

# ✅ Task 1: Print a simple message
print("Hello, Python World!")

# ✅ Task 2: Print your name
print("Hello, my name is [Your Name]!")

# ✅ Task 3: Try editing the message
message = "Welcome to the Python Roadmap!"
print(message)
```

👉 Your task: Edit the message, run it again, and see how Python responds.
